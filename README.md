# 4. You need to write an algorithm for finding the factorial of a non-negative integer n. Recall that the
factorial of n is defined as the product:
1×2 × 3 × …..× (n-1) × n
The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.
Draw a flowchart diagram for your algorithm.
Test the execution of the flowchart step-by-step on n = 0, 2, 6, 10
Implement the algorithm as a Python script.
Test the execution of the flowchart step-by-step on n = 0, 2, 6, 10
# 5. Write an algorithm to take a string from the user then reverse it (e.g. if it contains abbxc, then the
output will be cxbba). Implement it in Python.
## a- Update the previous algorithm to check if the given array is palindrome or not. Implement it in
Python.
## b- Trace your algorithm if the string is xyzzyx.
# 6. Write a while-loop to swap every successive pair of elements in an array A of 50 elements, i.e., A[0]
and A[1] should be swapped, A[2] and A[3] should be swapped and so on. Implement it as a
Python Algorithm
## 7. Suppose A is an array of 100 elements. Write a for-loop that stores the elements of A in reverse
order in a new array X. That is, A[0] must go to X[99], A[1] must go to X[98] and so on.
# 8. Write an algorithm to delete an element A[p] from an array segment A[m...n]. The specification is:
inputs: A - an array
m, n, p - positions in the array such that m ≤ p ≤ n
effects: The element A[p] is deleted from the array so that the sequence A[m…(n-1)] contain the
original values of A[m…n] except for A[p].
# 13. Design an algorithm for finding all the factors of a positive integer. For example, in the case of the
integer 12, your algorithm should report the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Implement it in Python.
# 16. Encryption is a very very important topic in computing. It means changing the data so that enemies
(or bad people) do not know what it is. This is needed, for example, when transferring financial data
like bank account numbers and credit card numbers through the internet.
Write an algorithm (in pseudo-code) that takes a message from the user and converts it to an
encrypted version using Cesar cipher. Cesar cipher, in the simplest form, is shifting each character to
the next one. So the message "abc" becomes "bcd" and the message "I love computers" become "J
mpwf dpnqvufst". Hint: Think of a solution that uses the ASCII code of the letter to generate the
replacement letter.
# 18. The German mathematician Leibniz (1646–1716) discovered the rather remarkable fact that the
mathematical constant () Pi ط can be computed using the following mathematical relationship:
# 27. Exercise 3: Write a Python program to calculate the sum of the digits in an integer.
# 28. Exercise 4: update exercise 3 to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not.
A positive integer is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of individual digits of the
number is equal to that number itself. For example, the sum of cubes of individual digits of the number
153 is 1* 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3 = 153. Hence, number 153 is an Armstrong number.
# 29. Exercise 5: Write a python program that takes two integer values (start and end). This program will
find all numbers (between start and end) which are divisible by 9 but are not divisible by 4.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line
# 30. Exercise 6: Write a Python program to calculate the power of two numbers. Don't use ** operator.
# 31. Exercise 7: Write a Python program to take from the user three integer numbers (x,y, z) and your
program should search about an operations (e.g., +, -,*,%, etc) that can be executed on both x and y
such that the result should be z, then you program would print x operations y = z
Input: Input:
2 3 8 10 5 15
Output: Output:
2**3 = 8 10+5 =15
# 35. Exercise 11: Write a Python program that will take a non-empty string and an int n, return a new
string where the char at index n has been removed. The value of n will be a valid index of a char
in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range 0..len(str)-1 inclusive)
Hint: Do not use loops, use string indexing, range, and concatenation
# 36. Exercise 12: Write a Python program that will take a string and check if it is palindrome or not.
# 37. Exercise 13: Write a python program to delete an element A[p] from an array segment A[m...n]. The
specification is:
Inputs: A - an array
m, n, p - positions in the array such that m ≤ p ≤ n
Effects: The element A[p] is deleted from the array so that the sequence A[m…(n-1)] contain the
original values of A[m…n] except for A[p].
# 38. Exercise 14 Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and
letters.
Sample Data: MyPython 3.117
Expected Output: Letters 8
Digits 4
# 39. Exercise 15: Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to print the SUM of numbers from LOW to
HIGH. Test with LOW=3 and HIGH=9.(2) Write a Python program to implement this algorithm.
# 40. Exercise 16: Write a python function that takes an integer number (size) then it generates Fibonacci
sequence with the given size. (Hint: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the
next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence
looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …)
For example: if we input 3 the output will be 1, 1, 2
If we input 6  the output will be 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
